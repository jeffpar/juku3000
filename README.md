# What is JUKU3000?

*Our goal is to let future generations experience the prehistory of Estonian computer games vividly — the JUKU school computer from the 90s must be usable in the year 3000!*

If you want to read Juku disks:

* [Märt Põder describes the libdsk/cpmtools method](/docs/kettad.md)

Juku emulators:

* [MAME](http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/dettaglio_mame.php?game_name=juku) (working emulator, the code can be found for the time being [here](https://github.com/boamaod/mame), RomBios 3.43m and JBASIC 1.1 ROMs to boot [here](mameroms), the code is expected to default after some time [part of MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/9946))
* [EMU80](https://github.com/vpyk/emu80v4) (a free-source lightweight candidate to be adapted to emulate chips of the same family as Juku et al)
* [Universal Emulator](http://bashkiria-2m.narod.ru/index/fajly/0-11) (emulates both [Juku](https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juku_(arvuti)) and [Iskra 1080 Tartu](https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartu_(arvuti)) to the extent of 80%, configuration files can be updated, but Juku lacks additional graphics and text modes, audio support and two-disk support, source code closed -- generally recommended to use MAME for emulation, but this emulator with its debugger and settings is a good reference material)

Juku operating system EKDOS:

* [EKDOS 2.30](https://p6drad-teel.net/~p6der/ekdos230.zip) (release December 1989, [notice](docs/ekdos230.txt))
  * [Source code](src/EKDOS30.ASM), CP/M 2.2 [customization instructions from Digital Research](http://www.gaby.de/cpm/manuals/archive/cpm22htm/ch6.htm)
* [EKDOS 2.29](https://p6drad-teel.net/~p6der/ekdos229.zip) (release 05.01.1988)

Background information:

* [Arti Zirk has collected Juku materials](https://arti.ee/juku/)
* [The Juku topic is important in the ELFA forum](https://www.elfafoorum.eu/forum/tehnikafoorumid/tark-ja-riistvara-foorum/64851-)
* [ZX forum extremely useful Juku E5101 thread](https://zx-pk.ru/threads/27298-juku-e5101.html) (in Russian)

This site was originally a hackathon project, which is documented below -- now there is an [LVLup museum](https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/LVLup) and computer museums [in Tallinn](https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvutimuuseum) and [at the Institute of Computer Science of the University of Tartu](https://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartu_%C3%9Clikooli_arvutimuuseum), with whose cooperation such things could become a reality.

_The historical text follows..._

## Experiences and expositions 22.09-24.09 2017

Museums would like to put on exhibitions of Jukus, ZX Spectrums, Ataris, Amigas, Commodores, Iskras, Yamahas, Tartues, Entels, etc., together with the software/games of the time, but there is one big problem with that — if visitors are allowed to touch these computers, the new ones tend to break. But what's the point of computers if you can't touch them?

The solution is to build a computer system from modern components that offers a user experience similar to the computers of the time, but is intuitive enough for today's users and foolproof enough that hordes of schoolboys could go over it every day.

## What does it take?

* Emulators, lots of emulators. However, emulating EKDOS with all interfaces is not an overnight project, but there are emulators for most old common platforms. They can be used.
* Software, a lot of software stuck on hard drives, diskettes, cassettes and tapes, especially that which has been modified, hacked or actually produced by the people of the country for the use of the people of the country. Do you have software that won't run on any known modern computer system? Did you write computer games yourself in the 1990s? Send it to us, we'll figure out how to breathe life into it.
* A hardware kit with an old-school CRT monitor, an archaic-style durable keyboard and the legendary Joystick!
* A user interface overlay that allows you to choose between different emulators, their games.
* A museum layer that allows you to get acquainted with the cultural and technical content of the prehistory of computer games. Night watch in the computing center? Kalevi street games room? The key to the school's Juku class? Zeroday cracks from the Dutch BBS with a 2600-baud modem at the expense of Eesti Telefon? BBSummer and spring? Mud player socks on an ATI terminal keyboard? All this ethnographic material deserves to be collected and told to future generations.

## How to get there?

The first step will be taken on the 22nd-24th in September 2017 at the Garage48 hackathon in Tartu ["Experiences and expositions"](http://garage48.org/events/garage48-elamused-ja-ekspositsioonid). If you are interested, want to give advice, help or simply share your memories, etc., please contact tramm@infoaed.ee or +372 55643754 — it would be useful for us if you could come by the hackathon to simply communicate with us on this topic, but still better than joining our team to create a prototype that could find use in a real museum in real exhibitions. We plan to hold a test exhibition already at the beginning of November, when a conference focusing on modern digital museum work will be held in ERM ["Open licences, open content, open data: tools for developing digital humanities"](http://dh.org.ee/category/events/dhe2017/), where Outi Penninkanga, one of the key figures of Finland's first computer game museum, will also perform.
